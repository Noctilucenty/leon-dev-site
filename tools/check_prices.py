"""Fail loudly when a published price contradicts itself.

Written because the reprice on 2026-08-20 shipped fifteen wrong figures. The
sweep that produced them looked for the OLD values and replaced them globally,
which both missed survivors and introduced new errors — a blanket
"$1,200 -> $300" also rewrote the phone agent, whose new floor is $1,000.

So this checks PER SERVICE, not per value: every figure that appears on a
service's own page must be that service's floor, or an explicitly allowed
cross-reference. Prices live on several surfaces that nothing syncs. Those
surfaces are checked here, and social/listing generators are separately
required to stay free of hard-coded dollar amounts.
